# Files in this folder and some words ..

This example uses a base windturbine. It contains the models of:
- Windturbine
- Foundation
- Windenergytower
- Generator
- Nacelle
- Rotor

Of course there are only some randome values defined as properties, just to provide an overview how to fill in some values. Also this does not reflect a "real" windturbine", it should only demonstrate the structural approach for this little exercise.
