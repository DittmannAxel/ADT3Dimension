# ADT3Dimension
Azure Digital Twin and the 3rd dimension

This repo will define a simple example of a windturbine, consists in its base form of five parts (foundation, tower, generator, nacelle, rotorblade) based on [Azure Digital Twin Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/). The ultimate goal is to have a 4K animation of the windturbine in 4K with real live data. <br>

**First Step** is to setup an ADT environment to create a basic fundament to work with.
I think for the beginning it is best to do the first steps with the ADT Explorer and replace the files to upload with the ones in the files section:
https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/azure/digital-twins/quickstart-azure-digital-twins-explorer .
For my example you can find some [files & explanation](files/) here.

A detailled explanation and results can be found here:
