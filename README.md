Azure Digital Twin and the 3rd dimension

First Step is to setup a ADT environment to create a basic fundament to work with.
I think for the beginning it is best to do the first steps with the ADT Explorer and replace the files to upload with the ones in the files section:

For my example you can find some [files & explanation](files/README.md) here.
