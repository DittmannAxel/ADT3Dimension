# Create the windturbine in ADT Explorer

First go through the setup for the service as described here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/azure/digital-twins/quickstart-azure-digital-twins-explorer 

Stop if you can see the window of the explorer. Than add the *.json files from the files-directory as nodes to the UI.<br>

If you have successfully uploaded all the files your explorer should show all these nodes: <br>

And than we need to upload the *.xlsx file to define the graph and use some initial data to populate the nodes.<br>

After the success message **do not forget to save**, because only after that the graph is in the system. The screen should look like this:<br>

And you can also see some intitial values from the *.xlsx file, if you klick on one node:<br>
